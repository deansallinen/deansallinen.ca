He usually works the\n        morning shift, but offered to cover for a co-worker tonight. Maybe it\n        wasn't the greatest decision — he still has to work the morning shift\n        tomorrow — but he knows the effect on his paycheck will be good.

He took the Skytrain this\n        morning but knows from experience it doesn't run late at night.

We could either:</p>\n\n      <p>\n        Improve the official website. Make it easier for users to navigate and\n        find the information they require. This would be an ideal solution, but\n        would mean I could only provide an unsolicited redesign and our users\n        will still have their needs unmet. Improve the Google maps option and\n        simplify the process for less-technical users. This would require a\n        redesign of the Google maps app to better advertise transit options, and\n        is not an easy undertaking. Create a new website. This would allow for a\n        tailor-made experience that solves the user’s problem directly. For this\n        project I decided to move forward with option 3 and create and new\n        website.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Why a website and not an app?</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        Where the users are: our users James and Emily are searching for the\n        train schedule, not an app.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        A native app requires forethought to download. Emily doesn’t take the\n        train very often, and wouldn’t make the psychological investment in\n        another app for her phone. James wasn’t planning on staying at work this\n        late, and wouldn’t have an app for this purpose.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Websites are cross platform. Both our users are mobile, but if we were\n        to develop a native app we would have to code for Android and iPhone. A\n        website would cover their needs and provide desktop support for users\n        who are checking this information from a larger screen (e.g. if James\n        were to check on the concierge iMac before the end of his shift).\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Development would be easier and faster. HTML and CSS with some\n        Javascript is cheaper and easier than writing native applications.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        train lines Nope. timeline view Nope. low fidelity mockup Yep. Why a new\n        site and not a redesign of the official site? Be the change you want to\n        see: a new site is something that can be designed, developed, and\n        released to solve this real-world problem independently of Translink.\n        This will allow us to build a product that takes a concept and\n        implements a solution. Ideally, Translink would consider the UX of their\n        site. In the meantime, we can help these users ourselves.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Reduced constraints: admittedly, this is a double edged sword. Without\n        constraints of existing branding, site structure, and content it gives\n        license for more creative solutions. However, starting from scratch\n        means that more difficult decisions need to be made which would have\n        already be taken care of by working inside an existing framework.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        The proposed design doesn’t preclude integration into the official\n        website. If Translink likes the solution, the unofficial website could\n        be folded in to the official one. As long as the user’s needs are being\n        met!\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Process</h2>\n\n      <h2>Inspiration</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        Early sketches were inspired by the \"Transit\" app, another valuable\n        resource for any commuter.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        There would be a list of train lines with big colourful buttons\n        including the time of the last train.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Transit app inspiration Transit app, available on iOS and Android.\n        Initial Sketches Initially the concept involved having a page for each\n        station, organized by line, with each line visible on the home page.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        A user could click through from the homepage to the appropriate line,\n        see the information they require, and click down to the station if they\n        needed more info.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        train lines Main page with colour-coded service lines. timeline view\n        Line view with station name and departure time. low fidelity mockup\n        Station view with all lines and associated departure times. Initial\n        Wireframes Early feedback indicated that the station view was redundant.\n        Once a user entered the line view, their questions had already been\n        answered.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        low fidelity mockup V1 - Tapping on a train line would take the user to\n        the line view. The idea was based around progressive disclosure so that\n        users looking for the departure time from the initial station had that\n        information immediately.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        medium fidelity mockup V2 - Better affordances on the buttons should\n        allow for easier discoverability. Prototype User Testing Hypotheses\n        Users should be able to find the relevant Skytrain line in the Home view\n        Users should be able to click on that line to find the Line view Users\n        should be able to use the Line view to find the departure time at their\n        nearest station Methodology The first test was conducted in an interview\n        style. Participants were asked to imagine themselves at a certain\n        station, eg. Granville, and navigate to their home station, eg.\n        Lougheed.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        They were asked to verbally walk through their thought process\n        throughout the experiment.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Results</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        After initial testing, I found that users were unlikely to drill down\n        into Station view as they either:\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Already had the information they needed from the Line view. Expected the\n        home page to include all stations, not just terminus stations. Another\n        insight was that users looked for a map view. They expected some method\n        of viewing the spatial relationship between stations and lines.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Takeaways</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        The initial concept involved users learning a new taxonomy. The metaphor\n        for the site was based on another app, which if users were not familiar\n        with (Emily usually drives and would not use a Transit app) then it\n        would be too time consuming.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Considering feedback from user testing and the context of our personas\n        (fatigued and intoxicated), the site design should be more compact and\n        more visual.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Round Two</h2>\n\n      <h2>Revised Ideation</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        Initial research helped inform the decision to reduce the site\n        footprint, eliminate the station view, and bring all relevant\n        information into a line view.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        To accomplish this goal, a new design based on the familiar Skytrain\n        route map was considered.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        skytrain map Transit map as seen onboard a Skytrain Frequent travellers\n        have seen this map so many times that most of them have it memorized, or\n        are at least familiar with it’s general shape and the relative location\n        of stations.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        This map is also seen by every transit rider unfamiliar with the system,\n        as they use it to navigate from their current location to their desired\n        destination.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Revised Sketches</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        The new design was based on the map everyone sees on the Skytrain, but\n        rotated to better accomodate mobile screen length.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        new sketch Station view with all lines and associated departure times.\n        Revised Wireframes The new design capitalizes on recognition over\n        recall. The classic Skytrain map has been turned on its side to make it\n        easier to view and scroll on mobile in portrait orientation.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        So while the map is no longer oriented as “north-is-up”, the colouring\n        of the lines and the progression of the stations should provide enough\n        context clues to allow users to orientate.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        As users scroll down they are also scrolling through time. The farther\n        down the page they go, the later the time of the last train. In a way,\n        they are following the path of the last train from beginning to end.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Users who are downtown, like James and Emily, are closer to the\n        beginning of the line. This means the train leaves earlier relative to\n        stations further down the list. This design prioritizes those stations\n        and minimizes scrolling for any user looking to depart from the downtown\n        core. This assumption can be tested!\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Prototype</h2>\n\n      <p>The second prototype:</p>\n\n      <p>\n        Hmm... looks like a lot of scrolling...
