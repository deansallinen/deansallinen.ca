Emily doesn‚Äôt take the train very often, and wouldn‚Äôt make the psychological investment in another app for her phone. James wasn‚Äôt planning on staying at work this late, and wouldn‚Äôt have an app for this purpose.</p>\\n<p>Websites are cross platform. Both our users are mobile, but if we were to develop a native app we would have to code for Android and iPhone. A website would cover their needs and provide desktop support for users who are checking this information from a larger screen (e.g. if James were to check on the concierge iMac before the end of his shift).</p>\\n<p>Development would be easier and faster. HTML and CSS with some Javascript is cheaper and easier than writing native applications.</p>\\n<p>train lines\\nNope.\\ntimeline view\\nNope.\\nlow fidelity mockup\\nYep.\\nWhy a new site and not a redesign of the official site?\\nBe the change you want to see: a new site is something that can be designed, developed, and released to solve this real-world problem independently of Translink. This will allow us to build a product that takes a concept and implements a solution. Ideally, Translink would consider the UX of their site. In the meantime, we can help these users ourselves.</p>\\n<p>Reduced constraints: admittedly, this is a double edged sword. Without constraints of existing branding, site structure, and content it gives license for more creative solutions. However, starting from scratch means that more difficult decisions need to be made which would have already be taken care of by working inside an existing framework.</p>\\n<p>The proposed design doesn‚Äôt preclude integration into the official website. If Translink likes the solution, the unofficial website could be folded in to the official one.

Emily doesn‚Äôt take the train very often, and wouldn‚Äôt make the psychological investment in another app for her phone. James wasn‚Äôt planning on staying at work this late, and wouldn‚Äôt have an app for this purpose.</p>\\n<p>Websites are cross platform. Both our users are mobile, but if we were to develop a native app we would have to code for Android and iPhone. A website would cover their needs and provide desktop support for users who are checking this information from a larger screen (e.g. if James were to check on the concierge iMac before the end of his shift).</p>\\n<p>Development would be easier and faster. HTML and CSS with some Javascript is cheaper and easier than writing native applications.</p>\\n<p>train lines\\nNope.\\ntimeline view\\nNope.\\nlow fidelity mockup\\nYep.\\nWhy a new site and not a redesign of the official site?\\nBe the change you want to see: a new site is something that can be designed, developed, and released to solve this real-world problem independently of Translink. This will allow us to build a product that takes a concept and implements a solution. Ideally, Translink would consider the UX of their site. In the meantime, we can help these users ourselves.</p>\\n<p>Reduced constraints: admittedly, this is a double edged sword. Without constraints of existing branding, site structure, and content it gives license for more creative solutions. However, starting from scratch means that more difficult decisions need to be made which would have already be taken care of by working inside an existing framework.</p>\\n<p>The proposed design doesn‚Äôt preclude integration into the official website. If Translink likes the solution, the unofficial website could be folded in to the official one. As long as the user‚Äôs needs are being met!</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"process\\\"><a href=\\\"#process\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Process</h2>\\n<h2 id=\\\"inspiration\\\"><a href=\\\"#inspiration\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Inspiration</h2>\\n<p>Early sketches were inspired by the \\\"Transit\\\" app, another valuable resource for any commuter.</p>\\n<p>There would be a list of train lines with big colourful buttons including the time of the last train.</p>\\n<p>Transit app inspiration\\nTransit app, available on iOS and Android.\\nInitial Sketches\\nInitially the concept involved having a page for each station, organized by line, with each line visible on the home page.</p>\\n<p>A user could click through from the homepage to the appropriate line, see the information they require, and click down to the station if they needed more info.</p>\\n<p>train lines\\nMain page with colour-coded service lines.\\ntimeline view\\nLine view with station name and departure time.\\nlow fidelity mockup\\nStation view with all lines and associated departure times.\\nInitial Wireframes\\nEarly feedback indicated that the station view was redundant.
