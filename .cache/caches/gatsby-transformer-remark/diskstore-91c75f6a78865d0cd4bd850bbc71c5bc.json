We could either:</p>\n<p>Improve the official website. Make it easier for users to navigate and find the information they require. This would be an ideal solution, but would mean I could only provide an unsolicited redesign and our users will still have their needs unmet.</p>\n<p>Improve the Google maps option and simplify the process for less-technical users. This would require a redesign of the Google maps app to better advertise transit options, and is not an easy undertaking.</p>\n<p>Create a new website. This would allow for a tailor-made experience that solves the user‚Äôs problem directly.\nFor this project I decided to move forward with option 3 and create and new website.</p>\n<h2>Why a website and not an app?</h2>\n<p><strong>Where the users are looking:</strong> our users are searching Google to find the train schedule, not the app store.</p>\n<p><strong>A native app requires forethought to download:</strong> Emily doesn‚Äôt take the train very often, and wouldn‚Äôt make the psychological investment in another app for her phone. James wasn‚Äôt planning on staying at work this late, and wouldn‚Äôt have an app for this purpose. Neither would really want to use their data plan to download an app they only use once.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites are cross platform:</strong> Both our users are mobile, but if we were to develop a native app we would have to code for Android and iPhone. A website would cover their needs and provide desktop support for users who are checking this information from a larger screen (e.g. if James were to check on the concierge iMac before the end of his shift).</p>\n<h2>Why a new site and not a redesign of the official site?</h2>\n<p><strong>Be the change you want to see:</strong> a new site is something that can be designed, developed, and released to solve this real-world problem independently of Translink. This will allow us to build a product that takes a concept and implements a solution. Ideally, Translink would reconsider the UX of their site and make changes themsellves. In the meantime, we can help these users ourselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Reduced constraints:</strong> admittedly, this is a double edged sword. Without constraints of existing branding, site structure, and content, it gives license for more creative solutions. However, starting from scratch means that more difficult decisions need to be made which would have already be taken care of by working inside a pre-existing framework.</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p><img src=\"&#x27;Transit%20app,%20available%20on%20iOS%20and%20Android.&#x27;\" alt=\"inspiration\">\nEarly sketches were inspired by the <a href=\"\">Transit</a> app, another valuable resource for any commuter.</p>\n<p>There could be a list of train lines with big colourful buttons including the time of the last train.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/f4fbecf6e19d9ce8f3e8e6cdb97b6de6/62af9/3.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative;

Once a user entered the line view, their questions had already been answered.</p>\n<p>V1 - Tapping on a train line would take the user to the line view.\nThe idea was based around progressive disclosure so that users looking for the departure time from the initial station had that information immediately.</p>\n<p>V2 - Better affordances on the buttons should allow for easier discoverability.</p>\n<p>User Testing</p>\n<p>Hypotheses</p>\n<p>Users should be able to find the relevant Skytrain line in the Home view\nUsers should be able to click on that line to find the Line view\nUsers should be able to use the Line view to find the departure time at their nearest station</p>\n<p>Methodology</p>\n<p>The first test was conducted in an interview style. Participants were asked to imagine themselves at a certain station, eg. Granville, and navigate to their home station, eg. Lougheed.</p>\n<p>They were asked to verbally walk through their thought process throughout the experiment.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>After initial testing, I found that users were unlikely to drill down into Station view as they either:</p>\n<p>Already had the information they needed from the Line view.\nExpected the home page to include all stations, not just terminus stations.\nAnother insight was that users looked for a map view. They expected some method of viewing the spatial relationship between stations and lines.</p>\n<h2>Takeaways</h2>\n<p>The initial concept involved users learning a new taxonomy. The metaphor for the site was based on another app, which if users were not familiar with (Emily usually drives and would not use a Transit app) then it would be too time consuming.</p>\n<p>Considering feedback from user testing and the context of our personas (fatigued and intoxicated), the site design should be more compact and more visual.</p>\n<h2>Round Two</h2>\n<h2>Revised Ideation</h2>\n<p>Initial research helped inform the decision to reduce the site footprint, eliminate the station view, and bring all relevant information into a line view.</p>\n<p>To accomplish this goal, a new design based on the familiar Skytrain route map was considered.</p>\n<p>skytrain map\nTransit map as seen onboard a Skytrain\nFrequent travellers have seen this map so many times that most of them have it memorized, or are at least familiar with it‚Äôs general shape and the relative location of stations.</p>\n<p>This map is also seen by every transit rider unfamiliar with the system, as they use it to navigate from their current location to their desired destination.</p>\n<h2>Revised Sketches</h2>\n<p>The new design was based on the map everyone sees on the Skytrain, but rotated to better accomodate mobile screen length.</p>\n<p>new sketch\nStation view with all lines and associated departure times.\nRevised Wireframes\nThe new design capitalizes on recognition over recall. The classic Skytrain map has been turned on its side to make it easier to view and scroll on mobile in portrait orientation.</p>\n<p>So while the map is no longer oriented as ‚Äúnorth-is-up‚Äù, the colouring of the lines and the progression of the stations should provide enough context clues to allow users to orientate.</p>\n<p>As users scroll down they are also scrolling through time. The farther down the page they go, the later the time of the last train. In a way, they are following the path of the last train from beginning to end.</p>\n<p>Users who are downtown, like James and Emily, are closer to the beginning of the line. This means the train leaves earlier relative to stations further down the list. This design prioritizes those stations and minimizes scrolling for any user looking to depart from the downtown core. This assumption can be tested!</p>\n<h2>Prototype</h2>\n<p>The second prototype:</p>\n<p>Hmm... looks like a lot of scrolling...</p>\n<p>Future Directions</p>\n<p>Revised Testing\nUsers should be able to quickly find their nearest station and the time of departure.\nUsers should be able to switch directions of the line\nUsers should be able to switch to a different line\nThe different lines on the page should be distinct enough to not cause confusion</p>\n<p>Methodology\nIn an attempt to get into the mindset of Emily, I will be testing users after they consumed a similar amount of alcohol.</p>\n<p>In an attempt to get into the mindset of James, I will be testing users after a late night shift at work.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>Hopefully the new design will outperform the previous design.</p>\n<p>If not, then elements of the two can be combined to create a hybrid design with the best of both.</p>\n<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>\n<p>This project has been instrumental in teaching the value of testing designs with users early and often. The faster you can get a design idea in front of real users, the less time you waste on creating something that doesn‚Äôt solve the problem at hand.</p>"}
