Young adults are less likely to watch cable TV, and therefore local news programs, which would feature election coverage on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>These millennial voters are more likely to look online for information to help them decide who to vote for, if they have decided to do research on the parties and the relevant issues.</p>\n<h2>Persona</h2>\n<p>Our target user was a young millennial, mid 20's:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Their first (or second) provincial election</li>\n<li>Cordcutter (no cable TV)</li>\n<li>Gets news from social media, internet savvy</li>\n<li>Beginning to take an interest in social issues</li>\n<li>Young career professional</li>\n<li>Living in the suburbs</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Ideation</h2>\n<p>The idea was to have an unbiased one-stop-shop to help get you up to speed on the election, inform your voting decision, and help you remember where and when to vote.</p>\n<p>Initally we wanted to create a dashboard where our user could:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>compare party platforms and candidates,</li>\n<li>view important election issues,</li>\n<li>candidate stances on the issues,</li>\n<li>find ridings and voting places, and</li>\n<li>add the election day to their calendar.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The scope was ambitious given the hard deadline of an election day and we learned the hard way there is always a tradeoff between scope, budget, and time.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/30341f6b09c7b6f1d97b610faf0ea193/ea25f/triangle-300.jpeg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 300px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"tradeoff triangle\"\n        title=\"Choose two!\"\n        src=\"/static/30341f6b09c7b6f1d97b610faf0ea193/ea25f/triangle-300.jpeg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/30341f6b09c7b6f1d97b610faf0ea193/df4c1/triangle-300.jpeg 200w,\n/static/30341f6b09c7b6f1d97b610faf0ea193/ea25f/triangle-300.jpeg 300w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">Choose two!</figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<p>We found that our initial scope vastly outweighed our budget and schedule.</p>\n<p>This was a side project done on evenings and weekends with a total budget of $20 or less (domain registration mostly). This means we would not be able to contract a team or dedicate the hours ourselves to implement all of the features we wanted to see.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our budget and time constraints dictated that we reduce the initial scope.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We also found that other players in the space were already doing parts of our idea better, including party comparisons (Vote Compass) and election issues with party stances (ICAN). Both of these services have been around for multiple provincial elections and have had more time to refine their sites.</p>\n<p>Our user would be better served by those sites, so we decided to focus on a more neglected area: finding the candidates. Prior to starting the project the only way to find a list of candidates was a PDF on the Election BC site.</p>\n<p>We thought this would be a good place to begin improving the election research experience for our users.</p>\n<h2>MVP</h2>\n<p>Throughout the project we knew we had to narrow the scope and focus on areas we could provide the most impact for our time investment.</p>\n<p>The minimum viable product was a list of all candidates displayed in an table view. We then added a search filter allowing users to sort by riding, candidates, or political parties.</p>\n<p>Before our time ran out, we were able to add:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>An \"Add to Calendar\" button which downloaded a .ics file with the date and time of the election.</li>\n<li>A couple of short articles written by our resident historian and political enthusiast @GustavoDestro on the importance of voting and a brief introduction to the B.C. parliamentary system</li>\n</ol>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/e64ab44e7764079fef5a3011d2d9b374/54bf7/mockup1-large-dark.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 54.400000000000006%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"screenshot of site with filter\"\n        title=\"Screenshot of BC Votes 2017\"\n        src=\"/static/e64ab44e7764079fef5a3011d2d9b374/37b83/mockup1-large-dark.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/e64ab44e7764079fef5a3011d2d9b374/60cc9/mockup1-large-dark.png 200w,\n/static/e64ab44e7764079fef5a3011d2d9b374/11d2a/mockup1-large-dark.png 400w,\n/static/e64ab44e7764079fef5a3011d2d9b374/37b83/mockup1-large-dark.png 800w,\n/static/e64ab44e7764079fef5a3011d2d9b374/54bf7/mockup1-large-dark.png 1000w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">Screenshot of BC Votes 2017</figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<h2>Design</h2>\n<p>Having previously worked as an election official, I've grown to like the simplicity of the design on the ballots.

Delay coding until at least one round of a design sprint was completed.</h4>\n<p>When the idea was conceived, we got excited and introduced technical debt by not considering how difficult it would be to create responsive tables. By then we had done too much backend work to justify changing to a different paradigm. Next time, we would benefit from doing an initial design sprint to better understand our layout and ensure front-end and back-end needs are better aligned.</p>\n<h4>2. Do more branding research before buying the domain name.</h4>\n<p>After we began building the product and hosted it on <code class=\"language-text\">www.bcvotes.info</code> we realized that CBC was prepending all of their pre-election coverage pages with â€œBC Votesâ€œ. This ensured our project would take a massive SEO hit and be buried under dozens of CBC articles, effectively putting us out of contention for the front page of a Google search. Next time, we would try and get a more unique name! I would love to see collaboration with a marketing or SEO specialist to better brand the product, be more visible to the target audience, and provide more people the opportunity to use the site.</p>\n<h4>3. Better git workflows</h4>\n<p>At the time, both of us were new to using git for version control. Since this project was created, I personally have learned an incredible amount about using git to collaborate with other developers. Branching, issues, and pull requests are tools we didn't know we were missing at the time and would benefit from using next time.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>It was my first time collaborating with another developer for a side project. It was a great learning experience and taught me the importance of development practices I'd only read about before.</p>\n<p>The site itself is not live at the moment, however I plan on hosting a static version with github pages at some point soon. The code is available to view on my github profile.</p>"}
