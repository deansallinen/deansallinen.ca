                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>This project grew naturally out of a frustration I had with the BC Ferries website.</p>
                <p>My family lives on the Sunshine Coast so I use the website to check the schedule when I go home and every time I'm frustrated by the user experience.</p>
                <p>It takes too long to find sailing information, the schedule is too confusing, and the page is difficult to use on mobile.</p>

                <h2>User Research</h2>
                <p>I did some research and I'm not the only one who feels like this.</p>
                <p>I found that a lot of people were frustrated in the same ways. They mostly complained that the site was slow and it was difficult to navigate.</p>
                <p>I categorized users of the BC Ferries website into three groups based on how frequently they traveled so I could better understand what features to target:</p>

                <h3>Commuters (Daily)</h3>
                <p>These people travel almost daily. They take the same ferry every morning and almost always the same ferry back in the evening. They know the schedule inside and out, when it changes throughout the year and if there are additional sailings. They use the website mainly to check live information such as: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Deck space committed</li>
                    <li>On time performance</li>

                <h3>Students (Frequent)</h3>
                <p>This group of people travels on the ferry frequently to go home throughout the semester or to visit friends on breaks. They often take different ferries at different times so in addition to live information, they need to know: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The schedule</li>
