                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>This project grew naturally out of a frustration I had with the BC Ferries website.</p>
                <p>My family lives on the Sunshine Coast so I use the website to check the schedule when I go home and every time I'm frustrated by the user experience.</p>
                <p>It takes too long to find sailing information, the schedule is too confusing, and the page is difficult to use on mobile.</p>

                <h2>User Research</h2>
                <p>I did some research and I'm not the only one who feels like this.</p>
                <p>I found that a lot of people were frustrated in the same ways. They mostly complained that the site was slow and it was difficult to navigate.</p>
                <p>I categorized users of the BC Ferries website into three groups based on how frequently they traveled so I could better understand what features to target:</p>

                <h3>Commuters (Daily)</h3>
                <p>These people travel almost daily. They take the same ferry every morning and almost always the same ferry back in the evening. They know the schedule inside and out, when it changes throughout the year and if there are additional sailings.
                    They use the website mainly to check live information such as: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Deck space committed</li>
                    <li>On time performance</li>

                <h3>Students (Frequent)</h3>
                <p>This group of people travels on the ferry frequently to go home throughout the semester or to visit friends on breaks. They often take different ferries at different times so in addition to live information, they need to know: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The schedule</li>
                    <li>Route information</li>

                <h3>Vacationers (Infrequent)</h3>
                <p>These are the seasonal travelers, going to the island for spring break or summer vacation. They are often tourists and unfamiliar with the ferry schedule or routes. They need the most information, often times well in advance, presented
                    in the easiest format. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All route information</li>
                    <li>Advanced scheduling/reservation</li>

                <p>To better focus on the initial goals of this project, I chose to focus on the first two groups: Commuters and Students. These users are the most engaged with the BC Ferries website and would be best served with a streamlined experience.
                    The infrequent user would still find value in the application while not being directly targeted, and their specific needs can be addressed in future iterations. </p>

                <p>This app on iOS shows deck space committed for three upcoming sailings but doesn't show schedule information, on-time/delay information, or previous sailings. </p>

                <p>I really wanted to have a "West Coast" aesthetic in the final product. Blues, Greens, Greys and Whites in the colour palette, with a touch of Orange for contrast.</p>
                <p>I also took inspiration from transit, calendar and weather applications as these all have something to do with the passing of time in relation to events. </p>

                <h2>Why an Android app?</h2>
                <p>Good question.</p>
                <p>I'm interested in web development and I follow the trends. One thing that really catches my eye these days is Progressive Web Apps. The notion that an app can be accessed via the browser and used without installation as pieces are downloaded
                    when they're needed -- that's cool. Combining this with service workers means that you can have a cross platform application that stays up to date without an App Store. This technology would be perfect for the application I have in
                    mind, and it would start with Android.</p>
                <p>Also, I think Google's Material Design language is the most user friendly solution to standardize mobile design principles. I use this as a starting point and as a guide throughout the process.</p>
                <p>So in my mind, this project presents as an Android app even though I would like to develop it as a Progressive Web App which follows Google's Material Design language.</p>
