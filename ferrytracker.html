                <div class="col-6">
                <p>This project grew naturally out of a frustration I had with the BC Ferries website.</p>
                <p>My family lives on the Sunshine Coast so I use the website to check the schedule when I go home and every time I'm frustrated by the user experience.</p>
                <p>It takes too long to find sailing information, the schedule is too confusing, and the page is difficult to use on mobile.</p>

                <h2>User Research</h2>
                <p>I did some research and I'm not the only one who feels like this.</p>
                <p>I found that a lot of people were frustrated in the same ways. They mostly complained that the site was slow and it was difficult to navigate.</p>
                <p>I categorized users of the BC Ferries website into three groups based on how frequently they traveled so I could better understand what features to target:</p>

                <h3>Commuters (Daily)</h3>
                <p>These people travel almost daily. They take the same ferry every morning and almost always the same ferry back in the evening. They know the schedule inside and out, when it changes throughout the year and if there are additional sailings.
                    They use the website mainly to check live information such as: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Deck space committed</li>
                    <li>On time performance</li>

                <h3>Students (Frequent)</h3>
                <p>This group of people travels on the ferry frequently to go home throughout the semester or to visit friends on breaks. They often take different ferries at different times so in addition to live information, they need to know: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The schedule</li>
                    <li>Route information</li>

                <h3>Vacationers (Infrequent)</h3>
                <p>These are the seasonal travelers, going to the island for spring break or summer vacation. They are often tourists and unfamiliar with the ferry schedule or routes. They need the most information, often times well in advance, presented
                    in the easiest format. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All route information</li>
                    <li>Advanced scheduling/reservation</li>

                <p>To better focus on the initial goals of this project, I chose to focus on the first two groups: Commuters and Students.</p>
                <p>These users are the most engaged with the BC Ferries website and would be best served with a streamlined experience.</p>
                <p>The infrequent user would still find value in the application while not being directly targeted, and their specific needs can be addressed in future iterations. </p>

                <p>There are some applications already out there that try and solve these problems:</p>

                <h3>We can do better</h3>
                <p>I could design an app experience that was:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Easy to navigate</li>
                    <li>Showed all relevant information</li>
                    <li>Made users lives easier</li>
                </ul>
                <p>My goal was to hit all those marks while creating something aesthetically pleasing.</p>

            <div class="col-12">
                <h2>Inspiration</h2>
                <p>I really wanted to have a "West Coast" aesthetic in the final product. Blues, Greens, Greys and Whites in the colour palette, with a touch of Orange for contrast.</p>
                <p>I also took inspiration from transit, calendar and weather applications as these all have something to do with the passing of time in relation to events. </p>

                <h2>Wireframes</h2>
                <p>I started this project thinking I wanted to create an experience that was the complete opposite of what came before.</p>
                <p>This meant lots of visuals, animation, and new navigation patterns. </p>
                <p>The first was simple: Swipe up and down to view the schedule through time, swipe left and right to view more information on each sailing.</p>
                <p>This "timeline" view presented a problem. Even with labels on each terminal, it looks as if the ferry is following a river and is travelling between more than two terminals.</p>

                <p>In an effort to clear up this confusion, I change the perspective.</p>
                <p>With a side view, it was clear that the ferry was travelling between only two locations.</p>
                <p>Though now there was no clear way to show the passage of time.</p>
                <p>Here I tried the idea that there would be a clock that would wind backwards as the user swiped up and down to go back and forth in time.</p>
                <p>The schedule would be displayed one item at a time, with more information on the left and right.</p>
                <p>The problem here is the schedule: there's no obvious way to see the entire thing at once.</p>

                <p>So I changed perspectives again.</p>
                <p>Here is an isometric view that puts the shore at an angle. This allows for screens at all four edges, leaving one for information and one for the full schedule for each terminal.</p>
                <p>This was incredibly confusing to everyone I showed it to.</p>

                <p>Throughout this process, I came to realize that by trying to be different for the sake of being different, I was making the app less usable.</p>
                <p>I was losing sight of the main focus: the schedule.</p>

                <p>At first I had considered the sailing the most important.</p>
                <p>Later I realized that the schedule, a collection of sailings, was more relevant to the user. Each sailing needs to exist in context with previous and future sailings.</p>
                <p>It was at this point that the design shifted to focus more on the route.</p>

                <p>The hardest part was deciding on a navigation pattern.</p>
                <p>I considered many different route selection options, and they all depended on where the focus was placed: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Terminal Focus</li>
                    <li>Route Focus</li>
                    <li>Saling Focus</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why an Android app?</h2>
                <p>Good question.</p>
                <p>I'm interested in web development and I follow the trends. One thing that really catches my eye these days is Progressive Web Apps. The notion that an app can be accessed via the browser and used without installation as pieces are downloaded
                    when they're needed -- that's cool. Combining this with service workers means that you can have a cross platform application that stays up to date without an App Store. This technology would be perfect for the application I have in
                    mind, and it would start with Android.</p>
                <p>Also, I think Google's Material Design language is the most user friendly solution to standardize mobile design principles. I use this as a starting point and as a guide throughout the process.</p>
                <p>So in my mind, this project presents as an Android app even though I would like to develop it as a Progressive Web App which follows Google's Material Design language.</p>
