Hi, I'm Dean. ðŸ‘‹

I'm from Vancouver, BC and I like to consider myself a _UX Developer_.

- I'm User-centered. I'm always asking, "How can I make this a better experience for you?"
- I love to code and I create my designs with both Figma and React.
- I'm a data-driven problem solver, life-long learner, design and systems-thinker.

My work history spans multiple industries and job titles and I draw on this experience when designing for end users.

I studied Psychology and Linguistics at SFU and I use my research and interviewing skills throughout the design process.

When Iâ€™m not working on my side projects I enjoy learning the guitar, discovering new gluten-free restaurants, hiking, camping and reading.

#### Education

- Brainstation, User Experience and User Interface Design
- Simon Fraser University, B.A. Psychology
- Simon Fraser University, Certificate of Liberal Arts
