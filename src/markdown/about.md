I am a front-end/UX developer from Vancouver, BC.

My work history spans multiple industries and job titles and I see my varied experience as a benefit when designing for end users.

I studied Psychology and Linguistics at SFU and learning about human behaviour has given me invaluable insights, along with the research and interviewing skills, which I use throughout my design process.

When I’m not working on these side projects I enjoy learning the guitar, discovering new Celiac friendly restaurants, and playing with my adopted rabbit Aria.

#### Education

* Brainstation, User Experience and User Interface Design
* Simon Fraser University, B.A. Psychology
* Simon Fraser University, Certificate of Liberal Arts
