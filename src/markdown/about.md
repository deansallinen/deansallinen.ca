Hi, I'm Dean. ðŸ‘‹

When I grow up I want to be a **unicorn** ðŸ¦„

Here's why:

* User-centered. I'm asking, "How can I make this a better experience for you?"
* I love to code. I create with both Figma and React; the right tool for the job.
* I have a sense of aesthetics, rhythm, and balance. Not trendy or flashy, but timeless and considerate.
* I'm a data-driven problem solver, life-long learner, design and systems-thinker.

My work history spans multiple industries and job titles and I draw on this when designing for end users. Every experience is valuable in it's own right.

I studied Psychology and Linguistics at SFU and I use these research and interviewing skills throughout my design process.

And in other news? I'm from Vancouver, BC. When Iâ€™m not working on my side projects I enjoy learning the guitar, discovering new gluten-free restaurants, hiking, camping and reading.

#### Education

* Brainstation, User Experience and User Interface Design
* Simon Fraser University, B.A. Psychology
* Simon Fraser University, Certificate of Liberal Arts
