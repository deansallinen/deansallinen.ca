      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        I am a designer from Vancouver BC currently focused on User Experience
        and User Interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        I come from an academic background in Psychology. Studying human
        behaviour has given me invaluable insights, along with research and
        interviewing skills which I use in my design process.
      </p>
      <p>
        My work history spans industries and job titles and I see my varied
        experience as a benefit when designing for end users.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I&rsquo;m not working on my design projects I enjoy learning new
        songs on guitar, discovering new Celiac friendly foods, and playing with
        my adopted rabbit Max.
